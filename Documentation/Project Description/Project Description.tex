\section*{Abstract}

We want to create an application for the android system so that the user can connect a phone or tablet to a PC(Linux/Mac/Windows) and be able to send mouse and keyboard events. Esentially the android device will act as a controller for the PC. The android application will feature a GUI that provides easy means to controll the the desktop computer, consisting of a qwerty keyboard and a rectangular area for a trackpad. We might also attempt to use the gyro functionality to controll the mouse, depending on our owerall progress.
